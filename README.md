# Attendance system using qr-code technology

###  The project aims to optimize the presence of students/professionals at an institution, providing greater efficiency for the task carried out.

--------

### Motivation: time spent and lack of efficiency in ensuring the presence of students on the IFRN campus

--------

Locations that have been/are being implemented:


* IFRN - Campus Currais Novos (Instituto Federal de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Norte)

### ðŸ¤” How it works?

#### 1. The person responsible generates a QR-Code using our API

#### 2. Students scan the QR-Code and are redirected to this page, where they fill in their enrollment and register their presence

#### 3. After that, a call is made to our API and the student's presence is applied after the teacher closes availability.

#### ðŸ¤© And that's it, the presence is done!
